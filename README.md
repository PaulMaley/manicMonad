# manicMonad
OK. Down the rabbit hole ....

So was happily working through Friedman and Wand learning how to build
interpreters with Haskell. Had an environment, a store, and some logging
which looked like an opportunity to introduce Reader, State and Writer
Monads. Ouch. Pretty clear I don't understand jack s!?t about this stuff
so I'm sticking it into a side project - this one.

Why not try to start using `stack` at the same time ?????

OK, `stack`is clearly overkill for this ... but got to start somewhere.

## Back to basics
